## Overview

    A Signup/register form can be challenging when people wants to be interactive. That's what this challenge was, at the beginning.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   From the previous challenge i was able to put error icons on the right position with _absolute_, but with multiple icons on a different inputs I found it's much more quicker and looks better with using background on the input itself.
-   Making email placeholder to switch the text and the color wasn't easy to, but with help from Chat GPT I managed to do it.
-   Refactoring the logic (in _javaScript.js_) behind the verification was a hard task too.

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   Vanilla CSS
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-   Have better gaps how to abstract JS logic;
-   Faster and easier way to build some elements of the form;
-   More CSS properties and how to use them;

### Continued development

I'll continue developing my skills with HTML , CSS and vanilla JS, because i think Fundamentals are really important.
